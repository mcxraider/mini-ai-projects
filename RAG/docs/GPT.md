Advice on how to handle the BM25Encoder

When deciding between Step 1 (using a global or singleton BM25 model) and Step 2 (passing the BM25 model as a parameter to functions) for creating a deployable API, there are several key considerations that depend on your deployment environment, scalability requirements, and how you manage state across API calls. Here’s a breakdown of both approaches in the context of deploying as an API:

### Step 1: Global or Singleton BM25 Model
**Advantages:**
- **Simplicity:** The BM25 model is initialized once and used globally, which simplifies the function signatures and the flow of data through the API. This is straightforward to implement in environments that maintain state (like traditional web servers).
- **Efficiency:** No need to reinitialize or pass the model for each API call, which can save memory and processing time if the API is hosted in an environment where the state is persistent.

**Disadvantages:**
- **State Management in Stateless Environments:** In stateless deployment environments (like serverless functions or scalable container-based deployments), maintaining a global state can be challenging and often goes against the design principles of such environments.
- **Concurrency and Scalability Issues:** Global mutable state can lead to issues with concurrency and scaling, as multiple instances of the API might end up conflicting or requiring synchronization.

### Step 2: Pass BM25 Model as a Parameter
**Advantages:**
- **Flexibility and Testability:** By passing the model as a parameter, you can more easily test your functions by injecting different models or mock models. It also allows for more flexible handling of different models based on request parameters if needed.
- **Statelessness:** This approach is inherently stateless, making it ideal for deployment in serverless environments or microservices where each call should not depend on the state of previous calls. This aligns well with modern cloud-native application principles.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity in API Design:** Your API endpoint or controller will need to handle model initialization or retrieval from a persistent store, which can add complexity to the API implementation.
- **Performance Overhead:** If the model needs to be loaded or initialized per call, and you're not using an efficient state-sharing mechanism, it could introduce latency and performance overhead.

### Recommended Approach for API Deployment

For deploying as an API, especially in modern, scalable, and potentially stateless environments, **Step 2** is generally more advisable:
- **Design your API to be stateless:** Each call to the API should ideally not depend on a previous state. This makes the system more reliable and easier to scale horizontally.
- **Initialize BM25 model on startup or load from a fast-access store:** If you’re using containerized applications or serverless functions, consider loading the BM25 model from a fast-access, shared storage solution (like Redis or another in-memory data store) at the start of each function execution. This balances the need for statelessness with performance.
- **Use environment-specific optimizations:** Depending on your deployment environment, you may have specific tools or services that can help manage model state efficiently. For example, AWS Lambda can use layers and container images to load models quickly, while Kubernetes can leverage shared volumes for model data.

Implementing Step 2 ensures that your API can be scaled across multiple instances without relying on shared mutable state, adhering to the best practices for modern API development.
